# Spatiotemporal_GNN
This is the final repository for Machine Learning on Graphs Course.
The notebooks are only for prototyping.

## training and evaluating
Both of these commands will train a graph neural networks and impute and create a csv with the imputed dataset
# training and evaluating on dataset1

```
python train_gnn.oy 
```

# training and evaluating on dataset2
```
python final_train_gnn.oy 
```
# evaluating the imputation
forcasting1.ipynb is used to evaluate the imputed dataset in the downstream tasks
